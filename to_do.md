#to do

- google reviews section (dont bother with api/auto grabbing functionality atm)
- instagram api integration - somehow get latest images from instagram feed



1. double check all href links before going live
2. make sure all images are properly rendered in the final build
3. double check website on actual different devices (not just chrome dev tools) - send to AJ, Tim, Ruby, Tilly, Mum, Noah (for iPad).
